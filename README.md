# NHibernate.FlowQuery
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/niklaskallander/flowquery.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/niklaskallander/flowquery)

An extension for **[NHibernate](http://nhibernate.info/)** that provides a better flow when, and a safer way of, querying over **NHibernate**'s *ICriteria API*.

Much like **NHibernate**'s built-in *QueryOver API* this project aimes to make it easier to query your database using **NHibernate**. At first glimpse you might consider this project to be redundant and useless since *QueryOver* already exist, but give it a go and you might find it a bit easier to use, a bit more flexible, and simply awesome!

If you want to find out more about **FlowQuery**, please head over to the [Blog](http://nhflowquery.wordpress.com/) where you can find updates on the project (new releases, etc.), and read the [Documentation](https://nhflowquery.wordpress.com/documentation/version-2-3/).

Enjoy! (:
